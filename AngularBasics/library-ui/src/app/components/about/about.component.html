<h4>About Bikini Bottom Library</h4>

<p>Welcome to Bikini Bottom Library. We are a community library. All the books are water logged. If you touch
    them they <b>WILL</b> fall apart, and you will be charged. You are free to ruin more books by donating them
    to us. But if you do, wow, fahrenheit 451 anyone?
