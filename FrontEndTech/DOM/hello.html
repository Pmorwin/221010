    // first step in our DOM manipulation, is we need to grab an element from the DOM
    const helloButton = document.getElementById("button")


    // the 1st arugment is the event that it will listen for on that element
    // the 2nd arugment is a CALLBACK function that will handle that event
    // Callback functions are functions used as arugments in other funcations
    // This is very similar to Javalin, the first arugemnt is what it listens for, the second is what happens
    helloButton.addEventListener("click",function(event){
        alert("Hello everyone!")
