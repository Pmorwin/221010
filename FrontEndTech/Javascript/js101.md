- Anything that can be written is JS will eventually be written in JS
    - As much as it pains me, some people like this language, and those wrong
    - It is a powerful language and it does a lot, but it makes me sad ;(
- ***Technically*** JS is actually the world's most popular languge
    - But this is only on a basis of use, not likability 
- All websites use JS
    - I mean all of them
- JavaScript was created in 9 days by Breddan Eich
    - Honestly, amazing feat pulled, considering every website uses JS
- JS has nothing do with Java, they were literally trying to piggyback on a popular language's reputation
- A big philosophy of JS is to be as ***flexible*** and unopionated as possible
    - But what does this mean in the grand scheme?
    - It means we are left with a lawless land 
- JavaScript has ***a lot** of "quirky features" and poor design decisions
- JS's original purpose was to make web pages dynamic
    - Click something, and something happens
    - Thats pretty good!
    - You can do this with CSS, Ive seen it, it is a nightmare
- There are 3 types of JS developers
    - Those who hate JS
    - Those who love and hate JS
    - Those who are lying themselves
- Modern JS is not nearly as bad as its original 
- ECMA (this doesnt mean anything anymore)
    - They are responsible for JS
    - This is the organization in charge of EcmaScript wich is a language specification that JS adheres to
- JavaScript as we know it is a language specification
- In order to **run** JS code you need a runtime environment
    - Browser (orginal home of JS's runtime environment)
    - nodejs (really popular)
