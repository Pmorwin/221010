// JS has primtive values. Though that is semantics. Primtives in JS are Objects

let name = "Patrick"; //String
let num = 25; //number, there are no ints, doubles, floats, just number
let b = true; //boolean
let n = null; // no value. You can set things to null in JS. Null is a value that must be explicitly assigned
let u = undefined; // There isnt a value availible. You should **NEVER** set something to undefined
// Undefined is the default value of everything in JS

let x;
console.log(x);
