# Browser Basics
- Web Browsers are the most common comptuer application that humans use
    - Because everyone uses them in some capsity
- Web Browsers are desktops apps that server as a platform for web development
- There are 3 main features of any given web browser
    - Render HTML/CSS
        - This is the visual aspect of the page you are looking at
    - JavaScript Engine
        - Excutes our JavaScript in the browser
    - HTTP Client
        - This allows to send and recieve HTTP Requests
- Web pages are effectivelly just some files that are quickly downloaded and displayed on your browser
    - ANYTHING on a webpage can be edited within your view by the user
    - You should NEVER put anything sensitive in your pages

# Three Pillars of Client Side Technology
- JavaScript
    - Logic and dynamic capabilities of a web page
    - You click and something then happens
- HTML
    - HyperText Markup Language
    - This is the content and structure of our webpage
- CSS
    - Cascading Style Sheets
    - Aesthetics and design of a web page (HONESTLY, I never use CSS. Bootstrap is just better)
- Web Assembly (Secret 4th Pillar)
    - Assembly level code is now supported on most browsers
    - But dont worry about it ;)

# Static Web Hosting
- Websites are just a collection of HTML, CSS, and JS files
    - Traditionally a webserver running on a computer somewhere in the world, would return html files when you call that specific route for that specific file
- Cloud services have allowed this process to be much easier
    - They allow you to publically host files
    - Super easy to host a website
