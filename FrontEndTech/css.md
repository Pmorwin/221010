# CSS
- Cascading Style Sheets
- This language is responsible for adding styling to our webpages
- **ALSO NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**
- Uses Cascading Algorithm
    - Determine the ultimate CSS applied to an element
    - Multiple CSS rules might apply to the same element
        - BUT the most **specific** CSS always wins

# Syntax
- Selectors and key value pairs called properties
- Selectors that you can use
    - id
    - tag/element
    - class
```css
p{color:red; background-color:green} /* p is the selctor color:red is the property    */
```

## Ways to add CSS
1. In line
    1. Directly attacked to an element
    2. This is the **MOST** specific version of CSS
```html
<p style="color:red;">Hi I am bob</p>
```
2. The Style tag
    1. This belongs in the head of our html file
3. To reference a Stylesheet
