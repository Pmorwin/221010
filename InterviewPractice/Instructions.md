- Once this is done, you will swap "sides" and the interviewer will become the interviewie.
- Once each of you have gone you will post your notes in the "Interview Perp" Channel on teams.
    - This post should include who you interviewed and the date.
- Topics will be Java and SQL.
    - Having the basics of Java and SQL well understood is a minimum for passing interviews.
