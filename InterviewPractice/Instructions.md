- You will be in pairs of two.
- You will take turns asking each other 10 questions.
- The person asking the question will write down the question they asked, and the answer they were given.
- After you finish asking your 10 questions and writting down all the answers, the two of you will go over the answered recieved and note any corrections that needed to be made.
- Once this is done, you will swap "sides" and the interviewer will become the interviewie.
- Once each of you have gone you will post your notes in the "Interview Perp" Channel on teams.
    - This post should include who you interviewed.
- Topics will be Java and SQL.
    - Having the basics of Java and SQL well understood is a minimum for passing interviews.
