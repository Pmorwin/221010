The only inheritance that you guys will be doing for the most part, will be inheriting methods from interfaces, which we will use today



JAVALIN - Recieves a login request
- Passes it to the service layer

Service Layer - Recieves from Javalin
- Passes it to the repository layer

Repository Layer - Uses the information to access the database
-It either gets back a user or doesnt
-Sends that information back to the service layer

Service layer - Performs "Buisness Logic"
-If it doesnt get back a user, login fail
-If it does get back a user, it runs it through some layer of identification checking (usually an if statement)
    --if(isAdmin){
	do this; Send a 202 Status code
	}
	else{
	do that; Send a 201 Status code
	}
