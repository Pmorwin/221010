# Database
- This is where we can store information
    - Information in a database "persists" so it is often called a **persistent format**
    - This is why another name for our DAO is a "persistence layer"
    - Benefits to databases are
        - If power goes off, you dont lose all of your stored data
        - As well, it wont be deleted through the stopping and starting of your application (generally)
        - We have a few storage formats
            - Hard disk
            - Magnetic tape
- There a lot of different Dialects of SQL
    - NoSQL
    - MySQL
    - and the one we will be using PostegreSQL

# SQL
- Structured Query Language
    - Programming language for **Relational Databses**
- Please understand, this is not like Java
    - With SQL you run once and what you ran persists
- Most versions of SQL arent case sensitive
    - The names of teh tables and columns are **VERY MUCH** case sensitive
        - You will be using JDBC to "target" these tables and columns, so you need to have good naming conventions and they **need** to match
            - Eg. e_id =/= employee_id and you will just get an error

- SQL errors are terrible and give next to 0 information
    - They are very unhelpful, so coming in with good naming convension, will only help us both!
- ***KEEP YOUR CODE CONSISTENT***

- **Table**
    - **Rows/Records**
        - Horizontal Rows
    - **Columns/attributes**
        - Vertical columns

- As a last note on naming convension, if something is only different by 1 letter, you messed up
    - employeeLoginAuthenticationCheckId //DONT DO THIS
    - employeeLoginAuthenticationIp //THIS IS NOT GOOD NAMING CONVENSION
